# Own_CryptoCurrency
You can create your own crypto by using this contract. If you want my "ATH" currency feel free to ask me :) 


- By using ERC20 protocol I have created this contract. 
- I have imported the ERC20 contract by using the github link of OpenZeppelin's ERC20 project.
- I inherit my contract from the ERC20.
- After inheriting I override the constructor in contract for custom naming and symbol
- _mint function is used to generate the currency.
- It called in constructor hence it will call once and you only have that much currency only.
- To avoid this you can call this method outside the constructor.
- If you want your currency should be added to your metamask you need to add the contract address in import tokens which is present at bottom of assest section of metamask

You can contribute to this project :).
Thank you.
